# Portfolio Overhaul

## Overview
	
Over the course of my college career I have created a vast array of projects. These projects are always very close to being exactly what I want, but could use a little more polish here and there. The goal of this project is to push the old from half baked and hidden to polished and presented on my portfolio.

## Tools
	
I do have a portfolio, but it is just html text and gifs so I will be upgrading it with more functionality. This means more info, more dynamic usability, and probably moving it to the git website thing you talked about in class. I will learn the web tools needed for git website you talked about. Even if I cant get that working I will likely apply my java script knowledge for html functionality. All the projects I'm considering upgrading are in Unity so I will focus on C# in actual development of the projects.

## Nuts and Bolts
	
The main reason I am wanting to do this form of project is to highlight my dynamic skill set, analytical ability and problem solving in any situation. A final boon of this project is a scalable scope, I hope to upgrade 3 projects but getting more or less done stays an option. The upgrades will be as follows:
		
- complete Tak AI update by improving defense
- Upgrade Wave Function Collapse by adding rollback
- improve the efficiency of my Kawahara filter. 

I am more then confident that I will be able to improve these projects in the given time but that's not really the point. The real deliverable is the upgrade to my portfolio, and these projects are secondary to the **presentation** of the projects throughout my college career. At the end I will be submitting any projects I worked on along with the portfolio scripts.

## So Far
	
At this point I have a first version up and running on the web, with project discriptions for several past projects! I still need to finish polishing up the final project I outlined above in the original plan allong with some minor upgrades like making it work for mobile, make it work better, etc.
